# Changelog of elbencho

## v1.9.0 (work in progress)

### New Features & Enhancements
* New custom tree mode option to create/read arbitrary tree structures of directories and files with different sizes (--treefile).
  * New elbencho-scan-path tool can be used to create a tree file from an existing dataset.
* New Dockerfile added
  * New official elbencho Docker repository with usage examples: https://hub.docker.com/r/breuner/elbencho
* New makefile option NO_BACKTRACE=1 to build without backtrace support for musl-libc compatibility.
* New option to load benchmark parameters from config file (-c / --configfile).

### Contributors
* Thanks to Zettar team (esp. Chin Fang & Oleskandr Nazarenko) for contributing in multiple ways to the new custom tree mode.
* Thanks to first time contributor Andy Pernsteiner (VAST Data) for providing the Dockerfile and testing on Alpine Linux.
* Thanks to first time contributor Edgar Fajardo Hernandez (Penguin Computing) for contributing the config file option.

## v1.8.1 (March 21, 2021)

### New Features & Enhancements
* New option for number of decimal nines to show in latency percentiles (--latpercent9s).

### General Changes
* Improved shared file/blockdev mode with multiple files/blockdevs.
  * For random I/O, each thread now sends I/Os round-robin to the given files/blockdevs.
    * This change was made to improve balance across different files/blockdevs.
    * Previously, each thread started with a different file/blockdev, but then only moved on to the next one after completing its full I/O amount for a particular file/blockdev.
  * For sequential I/O, each thread now writes a consecutive range of the aggregate file/blockdev size.
    * This change was made to improve consecutive access per file and to reduce the minimum required file size in relation to number of threads and block size.
    * This approach might involve multiple files/blockdevs for a certain thread, but will typically only involve a subset of the given files/blockdevs for a single thread.
    * Previously, each thread started with a different file/blockdev, but got assigned a range in every file, thus requiring block size times number of threads as minimum usable size per file/blockdev.
* Size of given files/blockdevs can now also be auto-detected in distributed mode.

### Contributors
* Thanks to first time contributor Wes Vaske (Micron) for helpful suggestions.

## v1.7.1 (Feb 06, 2021)

### New Features & Enhancements
* New tool "elbencho-chart" to easily generate charts from elbencho csv result files.
* New option for mixed read+write (--rwmixpct) to define percentage of block reads in write phase (-w).
* Faster default random number generators for "--rand" and "--blockvarpct" and new options for random number generator selection ("--blockvaralgo" and "--randalgo").

## v1.6.5 (Dec 26, 2020)

### New Features & Enhancements
* New option to verify data by reading directly after writing (--verifydirect).
* New option to control how well written data can be compressed or dedupe'd (--blockvarpct).

### Contributions
* New mtelbencho.sh (multi-test) script to run a storage sweep based on different file sizes. Added to new contrib subdir. Thanks to Chin Fang (Zettar) for this contribution.

### Fixes
* Fix compilation on platforms that don't define gettid().

## v1.6.3 (Dec 12, 2020)

### New Features & Enhancements
* New option to override service mode benchmark paths (--service PATH [MORE_PATHS]). These path overrides can be different for each service instance and will be used by a service instead of any path list provided by master.

### General Changes
* When NUMA zones are given (--zones), then set memory bind policy to only prefer these zones instead of strictly enforcing these zones. This is to avoid the OOM killer on systems where other processes already used up most of the available memory in a particular zone.
* Log backtrace in fault signal handler.

### Fixes
* Correct internal update order of phase done flags for worker threads, which could previously lead to process not terminating correctly in rare cases.

## v1.6.1 (Nov 28, 2020)

### New Features & Enhancements
* New directory sharing option (--dirsharing) to make all threads work in the same dirs instead of individual dirs for each thread.
* New option to truncate files to full size (--trunctosize) in creation/write phase.
* New option to preallocate file disk space (--preallocfile) in creation/write phase.
* File deletion (-F) can be used when benchmark path is a file.

### General Changes
* Renamed option "--notshared" to "--nosvcshare" for clear separation from new "--dirsharing" option.
* Filenames in dir mode now include the thread index (rank) to avoid conflicts in case of dir sharing.

## v1.5.3 (Nov 15, 2020)

### Fixes
* Fixed typos in Makefile related to automatic detection of CUDA path.

## v1.5.1 (Nov 9, 2020)

### New Features & Enhancements
* New support for Nvidia GPUDirect Storage (GDS) via cuFile API (--cufile & --gdsbufreg).
* New bash completion support in deb/rpm packages to complete parameters via tab key.
* Update embedded http server to latest release.
* New option to override service mode GPUs to bind service instances to specific GPUs (--service --gpids ...).
* Show service error messages in preparation phase also on master instead of only in service log.

### Fixes
* Disable phase time limit for sync and cache drop phase, as the low level calls in these phases are blocking.
* Disable phase time limit for worker preparation phase, as a time limit makes no sense in this phase.
* Avoid possible division by 0 with enable live stats in sync and cache drop phase.
* Properly release GPU resources at end of benchmark phase in service mode.
* Update automatic path detection during make for GDS v0.9 beta release.

## v1.4-3 (Oct 30, 2020)

### New Features & Enhancements
* Automatically detect availability of CUDA development libs on system and enable support. (Manually enable/disable still possible via Makefile options.)
* New `--version` parameter to show executable version, network protocol version and included optional build features (such as CUDA support).
* Move boost.org dependencies to separate Makefile variables (CXXFLAGS_BOOST, LDFLAGS_BOOST) to make it easier for users of custom boost libs.

### Fixes
* Properly release service host file descriptors and libaio context if benchmark was interrupted by I/O error or ctrl+c.
* Properly update cpu usage info during single line live stats.
* Do not return application error code when phase time limit exceeded.

### Contributors
* Thanks to first time contributors Chin Fang (Zettar) & team, Michael Chichik (Excelero), Marco Cicala (E4), Glenn Lockwood (NERSC/LBNL) for helpful comments.

## v1.4-1 (Oct 12, 2020)

### New Features & Enhancements
* New phase to sync write buffers to stable storage (--sync).
* New phase to drop linux kernel page cache, dentry cache and inode cache (--dropcache).
* New phase to stat files (--stat).
* New option to read service hosts from file (--hostsfile).
* New CPU utilization info in live stats and phase results (--cpu).
* New option to configure service host update retrieval interval (--svcupint).
* Print CSV headers only to first line of CSV file.
* Reorder CSV file columns for better readability and add CPU utilization info.

### Contributors
